GeneratingFunction

Implementation of the Laplace Transform of the distribution of coalescence times for a given sample under a given (demographic) model as described in Lohse et al. (2011). Includes efficient ways to calculate the probabilities of seeing particular mutation configurations under the coalescent with the infinite sites mutation model.
